The main body of the code is the main.m file. it uses the two functions: compare.m and sameRegion.m.
To excute and get the result:

1. choose picture: modify the picture name in the main function.

2. Comment the line (imshow(segM)), then it presents the lines of both sides of the road. 
Uncomment it, then it shows the segmentation of the line.

3. The codeTest.m file is a collection of options that can put into the command line directly.
For example, to see the lines of the vanishing points and segmentation line, you can type some so the command into the command.

4. I also enclose some of the sample pictures.

NOTE, to ensure the code works correctly, please choose the “standard” picture as in the data folder or described in the report
